# Recently-Used-List

In this Java project, I implement a recently used list using Test-Driven Development.

The recently used list is a list of items such as recently dialled numbers on your phone, or recently opened files in an application on your computer.
* The list should be empty when initialised.
* We should be able to add things to the list.
* We should be able to retrieve items from the list.
* The most recent item should be first in the list.
* Items in the list are unique, so duplicate insertions should be moved rather than added.
